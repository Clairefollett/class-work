## Today's Learning Objectives

* Object literal shorthand
* `class`
* `this`
* Destructuring and Spread

## Agenda

Try it out: https://babeljs.io/repl/

### Objects
* Literal
	* function shorthand
	* getters/setters
	* property/variable shorthand
* Destructure, Spread, Rest
	* Assignment to variable or argument
	* Property
	* Array Index
	* Requires `()` in `=>`

### `class`

* Prototypical Inheritence
* Props ontop of Props
* Same paradigm as scope
* Favor composition over inheritence
* Useful as container for combined behavior and state (date)
	* Compare Class vs Higher-Order Function
* Useful in API's as construct to build on (React `Component`)

### `this`
* Implicit based on call-site
* Functions
	* Explicit via `bind` and `call` and `apply`
	* Contextless `=>` functions
